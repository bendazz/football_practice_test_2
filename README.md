Practice Test Web App (Five-Column)

- Single-file app: `index.html` in the repo root.
- Five-column layout; each question sits in a cell whose height grows with content.
- Print-optimized: compact margins, light borders, no external dependencies.

How to use

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Edit the fixed questions inside `index.html` by updating the `QUESTIONS` array.
- Use the font-size slider to fit more on a page as needed.
- Use your browser’s print dialog to print (controls auto-hide on print).

Notes

- Designed for pencil-and-paper tests: no calculators or devices assumed.
- Questions won’t split across pages when printing.
- Keep questions concise to maximize per-page density.
